# passwordless connection ---- safe and reliable method
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# provide path
Press Enter to accept the default path (~/.ssh/id_ed25519).
Optionally set a passphrase (adds security).

# This will create two files
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (private key – keep safe!)
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (public key – share with remote machine)

#Copy the public key to the remote VM or cloud server
ssh-copy-id user@<remote-vm-ip>
# user can be root or normal user, provide password of that user for one last time
# after this you will login without password

# Test the connection
ssh user@<remote-vm-ip>
